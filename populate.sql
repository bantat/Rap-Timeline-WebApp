Active from 1986 to 1991, the rap group endured controversy due to their music''s explicit lyrics that many viewed as being disrespectful of women, as well as its glorification of drugs, and crime. The group was subsequently banned from many mainstream American radio stations. In spite of this, the group has sold over 10 million units in the United States alone. The group was also known for their deep hatred of the police system, which sparked much controversy over the years.\nThe original lineup consisted of Arabian Prince, DJ Yella, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube. MC Ren joined in 1988, with Arabian Prince leaving the group later that same year. Ice Cube left in December 1989 over royalty disputes. Several members would later become platinum-selling solo artists in the 1990s. Their debut album Straight Outta Compton marked the beginning of the new gangsta rap era as the production and social commentary in their lyrics were revolutionary within the genre.

She is best known for being a member of the Fugees and for her solo album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.\nRaised in South Orange, New Jersey, Hill began singing with her music-oriented family during her childhood. She enjoyed success as an actress at an early age, appearing in a recurring role on the television soap opera As the World Turns and starring in the film Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. In high school, Hill was approached by Pras Michel to start a band, which his cousin, Wyclef Jean, soon joined. They renamed themselves the Fugees and released two studio albums, Blunted on Reality (1994) and the Grammy Award-winning The Score (1996), which sold six million copies in the United States. In the latter record, Hill rose to prominence with her African-American and Caribbean music influences, her rapping and singing, and a rendition of the hit \"Killing Me Softly\". Hill''s tumultuous romantic relationship with Jean led to the split of the band in 1997, after which she began to focus on solo projects.\nThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998) remains Hill''s only solo studio album. It received massive critical acclaim, showcasing a representation of life and relationships and locating a contemporary womanist voice within the neo soul genre. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and has sold approximately eight million copies there. It included the singles \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" (also a number one), \"Ex-Factor\", and \"Everything Is Everything\". At the 41st Grammy Awards, the record earned her five awards, including Album of the Year and Best New Artist. She won numerous other awards and became a common sight on the cover of magazines.\nSoon afterward, Hill dropped out of the public eye, suffering from the pressures of fame and dissatisfied with the music industry. Her last full-length recording, the new-material live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 (2001), sharply divided critics and sold poorly compared to her previous work. Hill''s subsequent activity, which includes the release of a few songs and occasional festival appearances, has been sporadic and erratic. It has sometimes caused audience dissatisfaction; a reunion with her former group did not last long. Her music, as well as a series of public statements she has issued, have become critical of pop culture and societal institutions. Hill has six children, five of whom are with Rohan Marley, son of reggae legend Bob Marley. In 2012, she pled guilty to tax evasion for failure to pay federal income taxes, and in 2013, served a three-month prison sentence.', 'Lauryn_Hill_2012.jpg');

The production of the album was often halted by the lack of confidence that producers had in West''s rapping ability, eventually being convinced based on the success of his early musical ventures. Prior to the album''s release, West had worked on rapper Jay-Z''s The Blueprint (2001), which showcased his melodic and soulful style of hip hop production.\nThe album''s production was handled entirely by West, and features vocal contributions from Jay-Z, John Legend, Ervin \"EP\" Pope, Miri Ben-Ari, and Syleena Johnson and many other artists. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop, West''s lyrics on the album concern themes of family, religion, self-consciousness, materialism, and personal struggles. The album was promoted by singles including \"Through the Wire\" and \"Jesus Walks\", both of which received critical acclaim. \"All Falls Down\" and \"Slow Jamz\" both charted within the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, with the latter charting at number one.\nThe album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 441,000 copies during its first week. It was a massive commercial success, producing five singles that achieved chart success.

West collaborated with American record producer and composer Jon Brion to produce Late Registration, and the album features guest contributions from artists such as Jay-Z, Common, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Nas, Brandy, and Adam Levine, among others.\nThe production is notably more lush and elaborate than West''s previous album, The College Dropout. By collaborating with Jon Brion, West was able to utilize production styles and instruments not commonly associated with hip-hop music. More intricate sampling methods and the inclusion of string arrangements meant that the production featured on the album was unique to hip-hop music. West still sought to deliver lyrics that allowed him to continue his style of storytelling during songs, and the album covers topics of social issues, such as poverty, drug trafficking, health care, and blood diamond trades.\nThe album produced five singles, including the international hits \"Touch the Sky\", \"Heard ''Em Say\" and \"Gold Digger\", the latter of which topped the Billboard Hot 100 at number one. Music videos for all five singles were produced. West supported the album with a promotional concert tour, and the live album Late Orchestration. Late Registration debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 860,000 copies in its first week.

It was primarily produced by West and DJ Toomp and features guest contributions from artists including Mos Def, Dwele, T-Pain, Lil Wayne, and Chris Martin of Coldplay. The album''s cover artwork was designed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.\nWest was inspired by Irish rock band U2 and other musical groups to make more inspirational, anthemic hip-hop music that would function well while he was performing in front of tens of thousands in large arenas, so he incorporated synthesizer sounds into his production and dabbled with electronic music, while sampling a wider spectrum of musical genres. Lyrically, Graduation is more introspective in comparison to its predecessors, as West dedicated much of the album towards analyzing himself and conveying his ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame. It continues the education theme of West''s previous two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005).\nThe album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 957,000 copies in its first week. It produced five singles, including the international hits \"Can''t Tell Me Nothing\", \"Stronger\", and \"Good Life\". The coinciding release dates of Graduation and rapper 50 Cent''s Curtis generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums.

Following a period of legal and public image controversy, West took a short hiatus from his music career. During a \"self-imposed exile\" to Hawaii, he conceived the project; West subsequently worked on it through a communal development that involved him and other musicians and producers contributing collectively to its music between 2009 and 2010. Production was handled by West and several other record producers, including Jeff Bhasker, RZA, No I.D., and Mike Dean, among others. The record''s original cover art, by George Condo, was rejected by some retail outlets; it features a presumably naked Kanye West being straddled by a nude winged female, with a spotted tail protruding from her buttocks. A second artwork, featuring a ballerina in black holding a wine glass with red juice was sold in the stores who refused to sell the album with the original cover. However, the original cover was pixelated for iTunes.\nNoted by music writers for its varied elements, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates musical components from West''s previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic elements. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, with transparent lyrics expressing emotional extremes, ego, uncertainty, and references to drinking and drug use. Its subject matter also explores consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream. A short film set to the album''s content, Runaway, preceded the album''s release. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was promoted with free songs released through West''s GOOD Fridays series and four singles, including Billboard hits \"Power\", \"Monster\", and \"Runaway\", and the international hit \"All of the Lights\".\nDebuting at number one in the US, the album went platinum and spent 32 weeks on the chart, also charting within the top 10 in several other countries. Upon its release, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy received rave reviews from music critics, earning a rare 94/100 score on review aggregator Metacritic. Multiple critics called it West''s best work; its ambitious musical range, opulent production style, and dichotomous themes were all subjects of praise. In year-end lists, a strong majority of critics ranked the album the best of 2010. It was not nominated in the Grammy Awards'' Album of the Year category.

During the process, West gathered various artists and close collaborators for production on the album, including Mike Dean, Daft Punk, 88-Keys, No I.D. and Symbolyc One. Yeezus also features vocal guest appearances from Assassin and King L, as well as previous collaborators Justin Vernon, Frank Ocean, Chief Keef, Kid Cudi and Charlie Wilson. West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin only 15 days before its due date to strip down the record''s sound in favor of a more minimalist approach.\nWest was inspired by minimalism from design, including architecture, with a particular interest in the works of Le Corbusier, and visited the Louvre several times while in Paris. Musically, Yeezus is dark and sonically experimental, combining elements of Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial hip hop. West continues his use of unconventional samples, including (and most notably) the vocal refrain from Nina Simone''s cover of \"Strange Fruit\". Yeezus has no album artwork, and the physical CD edition of the album was released in a clear jewel box with only a strip of red tape and sample credits. Initial promotion of Yeezus included worldwide video projections of the album''s music and live television performances. West released two singles from the album, the song \"Black Skinhead\" in July 2013 and \"Bound 2\" the following month.\nThe album received rave reviews from music critics, who considered Yeezus one of West''s best albums and greatly agreed with the difference in sound he decided to use, compared to his previous albums. However, the public thought differently, with divided opinions emerging after the album had an internet leak four days before release. Yeezus debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 327,000 copies in its first week of release, but sales soon diminished. It topped the charts of 30 other countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia.
