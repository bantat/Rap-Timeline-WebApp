Active from 1986 to 1991, the rap group endured controversy due to their music''s explicit lyrics that many viewed as being disrespectful of women, as well as its glorification of drugs, and crime. The group was subsequently banned from many mainstream American radio stations. In spite of this, the group has sold over 10 million units in the United States alone. The group was also known for their deep hatred of the police system, which sparked much controversy over the years.
The original lineup consisted of Arabian Prince, DJ Yella, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube. MC Ren joined in 1988, with Arabian Prince leaving the group later that same year. Ice Cube left in December 1989 over royalty disputes. Several members would later become platinum-selling solo artists in the 1990s. Their debut album Straight Outta Compton marked the beginning of the new gangsta rap era as the production and social commentary in their lyrics were revolutionary within the genre. Rolling Stone ranked N.W.A number 83 on their list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time."" In October 2012, N.W.A were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time.

West first gained prominence as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records; he achieved recognition for his work on rapper Jay-Z''s The Blueprint (2001), as well as hit singles for musical artists including Alicia Keys, Ludacris, and Janet Jackson. His style of production originally used high-pitched vocal samples from soul songs incorporated with his own drums and instruments. He later broadened his influences to include 1970s R&B, baroque pop, trip hop, arena rock, house, folk, alternative, electronica, synthpop, industrial, and classical music.
West was raised in a middle-class household in Chicago, Illinois, and began rapping in the third grade, becoming involved in the city''s hip hop scene. West attended art school for one semester before dropping out to pursue music entirely in the late 1990s. Although his real desire was to become a rapper, record executives did not take West seriously, viewing him as a producer first and foremost. After being signed to Roc-A-Fella in 2002, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to commercial and critical acclaim. The baroque-inspired Late Registration followed in 2005, and Graduation in 2007. West switched rapping for singing on his emotive 2008 effort 808''s & Heartbreak, and embraced maximalism on 2010''s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Following several collaborations, West released his abrasive sixth album, Yeezus, in 2013.
West is one of the best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 21 million albums and 100 million digital downloads. He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all-time and the most Grammy-awarded artist of his age.

West''s background and style, from his debut album, deviated from the then-dominant ""gangsta"" persona in hip hop, and he would later alter the genre stylistically as rappers adopted his alternative aesthetic. An outspoken and controversial celebrity, West has often been a source of controversy due to his appearances at award shows and his various television and radio interviews.

As an entrepreneur, Fiasco is the chief executive officer of 1st and 15th Entertainment.
Raised in Chicago, Jaco developed an interest in hip hop after initially disliking the genre for its use of vulgarity and misogyny. After adopting the name Lupe Fiasco and recording songs in his father''s basement, 19-year-old Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak. The group disbanded shortly after its inception, and Fiasco soon met rapper Jay-Z who helped him sign a record deal with Atlantic Records.

Raised in South Orange, New Jersey, Hill began singing with her music-oriented family during her childhood. She enjoyed success as an actress at an early age, appearing in a recurring role on the television soap opera As the World Turns and starring in the film Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. In high school, Hill was approached by Pras Michel to start a band, which his cousin, Wyclef Jean, soon joined. They renamed themselves the Fugees and released two studio albums, Blunted on Reality (1994) and the Grammy Award-winning The Score (1996), which sold six million copies in the United States. In the latter record, Hill rose to prominence with her African-American and Caribbean music influences, her rapping and singing, and a rendition of the hit ""Killing Me Softly"". Hill''s tumultuous romantic relationship with Jean led to the split of the band in 1997, after which she began to focus on solo projects.
The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998) remains Hill''s only solo studio album. It received massive critical acclaim, showcasing a representation of life and relationships and locating a contemporary womanist voice within the neo soul genre. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and has sold approximately eight million copies there. It included the singles ""Doo Wop (That Thing)"" (also a number one), ""Ex-Factor"", and ""Everything Is Everything"". At the 41st Grammy Awards, the record earned her five awards, including Album of the Year and Best New Artist. She won numerous other awards and became a common sight on the cover of magazines.
Soon afterward, Hill dropped out of the public eye, suffering from the pressures of fame and dissatisfied with the music industry. Her last full-length recording, the new-material live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 (2001), sharply divided critics and sold poorly compared to her previous work. Hill''s subsequent activity, which includes the release of a few songs and occasional festival appearances, has been sporadic and erratic. It has sometimes caused audience dissatisfaction; a reunion with her former group did not last long. Her music, as well as a series of public statements she has issued, have become critical of pop culture and societal institutions. Hill has six children, five of whom are with Rohan Marley, son of reggae legend Bob Marley. In 2012, she pled guilty to tax evasion for failure to pay federal income taxes, and in 2013, served a three-month prison sentence.', 'Lauryn_Hill_2012.jpg');

The album''s title originates from the martial arts film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978). The group''s de facto leader RZA, also known as Prince Rakeem, produced the album entirely, utilizing heavy, eerie beats and a sound largely based on martial-arts movie clips and soul music samples.
The distinctive sound of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) created a blueprint for hardcore hip hop during the 1990s and helped return New York City hip hop to national prominence. Its sound also became greatly influential in modern hip hop production, while the group members'' explicit, humorous, and free-associative lyrics have served as a template for many subsequent hip hop records. Serving as a landmark record in the era of hip hop known as the East Coast Renaissance, its influence helped lead the way for several other East Coast hip hop artists, including Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, and Jay-Z.
Despite its raw, underground sound, the album had surprising chart success, peaking at number 41 on the US Billboard 200 chart. By 1995, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold over two million copies in the United States.

The album has been viewed as the pioneering record of gangsta rap with its ever-present profanity and violent lyrics. It has been considered groundbreaking by music writers and has had an enormous impact on the evolution of West Coast hip hop.
Straight Outta Compton redefined the direction of hip hop, which resulted in lyrics concerning the gangster lifestyle becoming the driving force in sales figures.

It was recorded over a period of four years, beginning in 1999. The production of the album was often halted by the lack of confidence that producers had in West''s rapping ability, eventually being convinced based on the success of his early musical ventures. Prior to the album''s release, West had worked on rapper Jay-Z''s The Blueprint (2001), which showcased his melodic and soulful style of hip hop production.
The album''s production was handled entirely by West, and features vocal contributions from Jay-Z, John Legend, Ervin ""EP"" Pope, Miri Ben-Ari, and Syleena Johnson and many other artists. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop, West''s lyrics on the album concern themes of family, religion, self-consciousness, materialism, and personal struggles. The album was promoted by singles including ""Through the Wire"" and ""Jesus Walks"", both of which received critical acclaim. ""All Falls Down"" and ""Slow Jamz"" both charted within the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, with the latter charting at number one.
The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 441,000 copies during its first week. It was a massive commercial success, producing five singles that achieved chart success. Upon its release, The College Dropout received universal acclaim from music critics and earned West several accolades, including a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 47th Grammy Awards. It is West''s best-selling album in the United States, with domestic sales of 3.4 million copies and worldwide sales of over four million copies.

Recording sessions for the album took place over the course of a year at Record Plant Studios, Chalice Recording Studios, and Grandmaster Recording Studios in Hollywood, and at Sony Music Studios in New York City. West collaborated with American record producer and composer Jon Brion to produce Late Registration, and the album features guest contributions from artists such as Jay-Z, Common, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Nas, Brandy, and Adam Levine, among others.
The production is notably more lush and elaborate than West''s previous album, The College Dropout. By collaborating with Jon Brion, West was able to utilize production styles and instruments not commonly associated with hip-hop music. More intricate sampling methods and the inclusion of string arrangements meant that the production featured on the album was unique to hip-hop music. West still sought to deliver lyrics that allowed him to continue his style of storytelling during songs, and the album covers topics of social issues, such as poverty, drug trafficking, health care, and blood diamond trades.
The album produced five singles, including the international hits ""Touch the Sky"", ""Heard ''Em Say"" and ""Gold Digger"", the latter of which topped the Billboard Hot 100 at number one. Music videos for all five singles were produced. West supported the album with a promotional concert tour, and the live album Late Orchestration. Late Registration debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 860,000 copies in its first week. The album has thus far sold over 3.1 million units in the United States and has been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Recording sessions for the album took place during 2005 to 2007 at Chung King Studios and Sony Music Studios in New York City and at Chalice Studios and The Record Plant in Los Angeles. It was primarily produced by West and DJ Toomp and features guest contributions from artists including Mos Def, Dwele, T-Pain, Lil Wayne, and Chris Martin of Coldplay. The album''s cover artwork was designed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.
West was inspired by Irish rock band U2 and other musical groups to make more inspirational, anthemic hip-hop music that would function well while he was performing in front of tens of thousands in large arenas, so he incorporated synthesizer sounds into his production and dabbled with electronic music, while sampling a wider spectrum of musical genres. Lyrically, Graduation is more introspective in comparison to its predecessors, as West dedicated much of the album towards analyzing himself and conveying his ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame. It continues the education theme of West''s previous two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005).
The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 957,000 copies in its first week. It produced five singles, including the international hits ""Can''t Tell Me Nothing"", ""Stronger"", and ""Good Life"". The coinciding release dates of Graduation and rapper 50 Cent''s Curtis generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums. Graduation received generally positive reviews from music critics and earned West several accolades, including his third Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.

Following a period of legal and public image controversy, West took a short hiatus from his music career. During a ""self-imposed exile"" to Hawaii, he conceived the project; West subsequently worked on it through a communal development that involved him and other musicians and producers contributing collectively to its music between 2009 and 2010. Production was handled by West and several other record producers, including Jeff Bhasker, RZA, No I.D., and Mike Dean, among others. The record''s original cover art, by George Condo, was rejected by some retail outlets; it features a presumably naked Kanye West being straddled by a nude winged female, with a spotted tail protruding from her buttocks. A second artwork, featuring a ballerina in black holding a wine glass with red juice was sold in the stores who refused to sell the album with the original cover. However, the original cover was pixelated for iTunes.
Noted by music writers for its varied elements, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates musical components from West''s previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic elements. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, with transparent lyrics expressing emotional extremes, ego, uncertainty, and references to drinking and drug use. Its subject matter also explores consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream. A short film set to the album''s content, Runaway, preceded the album''s release. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was promoted with free songs released through West''s GOOD Fridays series and four singles, including Billboard hits ""Power"", ""Monster"", and ""Runaway"", and the international hit ""All of the Lights"".
Debuting at number one in the US, the album went platinum and spent 32 weeks on the chart, also charting within the top 10 in several other countries. Upon its release, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy received rave reviews from music critics, earning a rare 94/100 score on review aggregator Metacritic. Multiple critics called it West''s best work; its ambitious musical range, opulent production style, and dichotomous themes were all subjects of praise. In year-end lists, a strong majority of critics ranked the album the best of 2010. It was not nominated in the Grammy Awards'' Album of the Year category.

It was released on June 18, 2013, by Def Jam Recordings. The album began production in the living room of a loft space at a Paris hotel. During the process, West gathered various artists and close collaborators for production on the album, including Mike Dean, Daft Punk, 88-Keys, No I.D. and Symbolyc One. Yeezus also features vocal guest appearances from Assassin and King L, as well as previous collaborators Justin Vernon, Frank Ocean, Chief Keef, Kid Cudi and Charlie Wilson. West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin only 15 days before its due date to strip down the record''s sound in favor of a more minimalist approach.
West was inspired by minimalism from design, including architecture, with a particular interest in the works of Le Corbusier, and visited the Louvre several times while in Paris. Musically, Yeezus is dark and sonically experimental, combining elements of Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial hip hop. West continues his use of unconventional samples, including (and most notably) the vocal refrain from Nina Simone''s cover of ""Strange Fruit"". Yeezus has no album artwork, and the physical CD edition of the album was released in a clear jewel box with only a strip of red tape and sample credits. Initial promotion of Yeezus included worldwide video projections of the album''s music and live television performances. West released two singles from the album, the song ""Black Skinhead"" in July 2013 and ""Bound 2"" the following month.
The album received rave reviews from music critics, who considered Yeezus one of West''s best albums and greatly agreed with the difference in sound he decided to use, compared to his previous albums. However, the public thought differently, with divided opinions emerging after the album had an internet leak four days before release. Yeezus debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 327,000 copies in its first week of release, but sales soon diminished. It topped the charts of 30 other countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia. After less than two months of release, the album was certified gold by the RIAA and later platinum on January 8, 2014.

The album was financed by MF Grimm who also supplied many of the samples in his capacity as executive producer. The album was also recorded in his basement. Despite this, he has never been paid any of the royalties he was entitled to, leading to a beef between the two artists for a period of time in the mid-2000s.

Expanding on the sonic aesthetic of his debut album, Take Care features an atmospheric sound that is characterized by low-key musical elements and incorporates R&B, pop, electronica, and post-dubstep styles.

The album has been noted by music writers for its minimalist R&B elements, existential subject matter, conflicted lyrics, and Drake''s alternately sung and rapped vocals. Becoming one of the most anticipated music releases in 2011, Take Care experienced several delays to its release date and subsequently leaked to the Internet nine days before its scheduled release.
It was promoted with eight singles\u2014 ""Marvins Room"", ""Headlines"", ""Make Me Proud"", ""The Motto"", ""Take Care"", ""HYFR (Hell Ya Fucking Right)"", ""Crew Love"", and ""Lord Knows""\u2014all of which attained chart success, and Drake''s Club Paradise Tour in 2012.
